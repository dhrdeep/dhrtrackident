### Admin Access

Navigate to `/admin` to access the admin dashboard.

## Troubleshooting

### "invalid_client" Error

This error occurs when:
1. **Missing credentials**: `.env` file not created or empty
2. **Wrong credentials**: Client ID/Secret don't match your Patreon app
3. **Redirect URI mismatch**: The redirect URI in your Patreon app doesn't match the one in `.env`

**Solution**: Follow the Patreon setup steps above carefully.

### "Configuration Required" Warning

The admin dashboard will show configuration warnings if:
- Environment variables are not set
- Credentials are still using placeholder values
- Redirect URI doesn't match current domain

### Debug Information

The browser console will show detailed information about:
- Configuration validation
- OAuth flow steps
- API request/response details
- Error messages with specific causes

## API Integration

### Patreon API

The system uses Patreon's OAuth 2.0 API to:
- Authenticate campaign owners
- Fetch campaign information
- Retrieve patron pledges
- Sync subscription data

### Track Identification

Uses multiple services for track identification:
- **ACRCloud** - Primary identification service
- **Shazam** - Fallback service

## Deployment

### Environment Variables for Production

Update your `.env` for production:

```bash
VITE_PATREON_REDIRECT_URI=https://yourdomain.com/auth/patreon/callback
```

Make sure to update your Patreon app's redirect URI to match your production domain.

### Security Considerations

1. **Admin Route Protection** - Add authentication to `/admin`
2. **API Key Security** - Store sensitive keys server-side
3. **HTTPS** - Use HTTPS in production
4. **CORS** - Configure proper CORS settings
