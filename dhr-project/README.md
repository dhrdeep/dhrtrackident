## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

### Admin Access

Navigate to `/admin` to access the admin dashboard. In production, you should add proper authentication to protect this route.

## API Integration

### Patreon API

The system uses Patreon's OAuth 2.0 API to:
- Authenticate campaign owners
- Fetch campaign information
- Retrieve patron pledges
- Sync subscription data

### Track Identification

Uses multiple services for track identification:
- **ACRCloud** - Primary identification service
- **Shazam** - Fallback service

## Deployment

### Environment Variables for Production

Update your `.env` for production:

```bash
VITE_PATREON_REDIRECT_URI=https://yourdomain.com/auth/patreon/callback
```

### Security Considerations

1. **Admin Route Protection** - Add authentication to `/admin`
2. **API Key Security** - Store sensitive keys server-side
3. **HTTPS** - Use HTTPS in production
4. **CORS** - Configure proper CORS settings
